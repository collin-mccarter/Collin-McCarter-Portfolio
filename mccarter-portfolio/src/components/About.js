                My name is Collin McCarter and I am a recent graduate of a Full-Stack Web Development Coding Bootcamp through the University of Texas at Austin.
            </p>
            <p>
                I gained hands-on experience in building responsive and user-friendly websites. During my studies, I honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various front-end frameworks like React and Vue.js. I have a solid understanding of UI/UX principles and strive to create visually appealing and intuitive web interfaces. Additionally, I am proficient in version control systems such as Git, which enables me to collaborate effectively with other developers.

                During the program, I had the opportunity to work with a team of experienced developers on a real-world project. This experience allowed me to contribute to the development of a dynamic web application using technologies such as Node.js and Express.js. I also gained exposure to database management systems like MongoDB, further expanding my skill set.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am a quick learner, always eager to explore new technologies and trends in the web development industry. I am particularly interested in gaining more experience in full-stack development and working on projects that challenge me to solve complex problems.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a junior web developer, I am seeking opportunities to contribute my skills and grow within a collaborative and innovative team. I am open to both freelance and full-time positions, as I believe each offers unique opportunities for professional development.
            </p>
            <p>
