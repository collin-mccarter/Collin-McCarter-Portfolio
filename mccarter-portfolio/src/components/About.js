            <p>
                My name is Collin McCarter and I am a recent graduate of a Full-Stack Web Development Coding Bootcamp through the University of Texas at Austin.
            </p>
            <p>
                I wanted to be a Full-Stack Web Developer because I am driven by a passion for problem solving, collaborating, and most importantly, incorporating creativity into web design. Since graduating, I have a strong passion and desire to apply what I have learned over the course of the bootcamp and to continue to gain as much knowledge and experience as I can about web development!
